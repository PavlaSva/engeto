# Elections scraper project 3 Engeto python academy

Purpose of the project:

The code downloads data from https://volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps3?xjazyk=CZ. User chooses from obce and the script downloads respective data and generates csv file, which is saved into same folder as script file. Output csv file contains columns: code of the city, name of the city, number of registered electors, ballots entered into elections, total valid votes, each political party has its column with total valid votes. 

How to run the code:
User has to enter two valid arguments: link to chosen city and name of output file.

To get the argument no. 1, user chooses city from column "Vyber obce" - copy the link under letter X. To get argument no. 2, type vysledky_{name_of_chosen_city}.csv. Both argumets have to be in " ".

Enter eg. python project03.py "https://volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps32?xjazyk=CZ&xkraj=12&xnumnuts=7103" "vysledky_prostejov.csv" to run the script.
